# Smart Security System for Agricultural Land

### Overview:
This project presents a cost-effective and reliable smart security system for agricultural land using a custom-built motion sensor that detects wild animals through infrared waves.

### Motivation:

Agricultural land faces significant threats from wild animals, leading to crop damage and reduced harvest. Existing commercial IR sensors often have limited range and detection angles, making them less effective for large fields.

### Our Solution:

- Custom motion sensor: This sensor utilizes an IR transmitter and photodiode to detect reflected waves from moving objects. Compared to commercial options, it offers:
- Increased range: Improved detection for a wider area of agricultural land.
- Wider detection angle: Reduces blind spots and enhances overall coverage.
- Cost-effectiveness: Built with readily available components, making it affordable for farmers.
  
### Further Development:

- Data Analysis and Alerts: Integration with data processing and alert systems could notify farmers of animal presence in real-time.
- Machine Learning: Implementing machine learning algorithms could differentiate between wild animals and other movement sources, minimizing false alarms.
- Solar Power Integration: Powering the system with solar panels would provide a sustainable and eco-friendly solution.
