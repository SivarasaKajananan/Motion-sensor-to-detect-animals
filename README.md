# Motion-sensor-to-detect-animals
A security system is an important need for  agricultural land. A lot of attacks and threats will occur due to  the wild animals to the crops. In case to get a good harvest and  income, smart security systems should be well implemented. In  this research, we made a motion sensor to detect wild animals  by sending and receiving infrared waves. Built to accomplish  the term of cheap, effective, reliable, and applicable sensors  that have been contained extra features. The main process  works by attaching the IR transmitter and photodiode.  Normally it detects the motion by getting reflected IR waves  from the objects. Already IR sensors are available in the  market to detect the motion. But they have a short-range and  small detection angle. In our research, we are trying to detect the motion at a higher range and higher angle. This result  seems to satisfy a large area of the detection and inference  from other IR sources can be eliminated here.
